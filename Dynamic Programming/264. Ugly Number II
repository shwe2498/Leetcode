264. Ugly Number II

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.

Example 1:
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

class Solution {
public:
    int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n+1);
        dp[0] = 1;
        
        int p2 = 0;
        int p3 = 0;
        int p5 = 0;
        
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            dp[i] = min({dp[p2] * 2, dp[p3] * 3, dp[p5] * 5});
            
            if(dp[i] == 2 * dp[p2]) p2++;
            if(dp[i] == 3 * dp[p3]) p3++;
            if(dp[i] == 5 * dp[p5]) p5++;
        }
        
        return dp[n - 1];
    }
};
