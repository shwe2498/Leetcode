1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings
Given an integer n, return the number of strings of length n that consist only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and are lexicographically sorted.

A string s is lexicographically sorted if for all valid i, s[i] is the same as or comes before s[i+1] in the alphabet.

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: The 5 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are ["a","e","i","o","u"].

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: The 15 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are
["aa","ae","ai","ao","au","ee","ei","eo","eu","ii","io","iu","oo","ou","uu"].
Note that "ea" is not a valid string since 'e' comes after 'a' in the alphabet.

Example 3:
Input: n = 33
Output: 66045

class Solution {
public:
    int countVowelStrings(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(5, 1);

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
          vector<int> newDp(5);
          for (int j = 0; j < 5; ++j)
            for (int k = 0; k <= j; ++k)
              newDp[j] += dp[k];
          dp = move(newDp);
        }

        return accumulate(begin(dp), end(dp), 0);
    }
};
